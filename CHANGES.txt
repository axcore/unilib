v1.0.0 (1 Jan 2025)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first beta release
- Future releases will NOT introduce game-breaking changes, so it is now safe to start a long-term
    game (or a server)

v0.15.0 (1 Oct 2023)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first alpha release
- Future releases may introduce game-breaking changes. Don't invest a lot of time and energy into
    your game (unless you are willing to maintain the code yourself)
