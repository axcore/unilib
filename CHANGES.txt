---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NEW EXPANSION PACKS
- unimobs (https://github.com/axcore/unimobs)
    - Provides dozens of creatures and a few monsters
    - Included by default in unigame
- unidrinks (https://github.com/axcore/unidrinks) (18+)
    - Provides a selection of alcoholic drinks, but no intoxication mechanics; it may be suitable
        for younger players, at their parents' discretion
    - Not included by default in unigame
    - The "drink_beer_light" package, originally in unilib, has been moved to unidrinks. If you
        want it in your game, add the "bbq_extra" remix
- The unilib code that handles expansion packs has been overhauled, as a result, all expansion packs
    now require unilib v1.1.0, unigame v1.1.0, or any later version

NEW IMPORTED MODS
- Colored Meselamps (remix: "misc")
    - https://github.com/slashdevslashurandom/colored-meselamps
- Natural Slopes Library (remix: n/a)
    - https://content.luanti.org/packages/karamel/naturalslopeslib/
    - Effect disabled by default; you can enable it in settings
    - When enabled, natural slopes should apply to most surfaces, not just those imported from
        minetest_game
- Natural Slopes for minetest_game (remix: n/a)
    - https://content.luanti.org/packages/karamel/naturalslopes_minetest_game/

MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Added some new soil nodes, matching their corresponding dirts (for example, black dirt is now
    converted to black soil, not ordinary soil, when a hoe is used on it)
- Added remix labels, so that packages reading data directly from remix CSV files can read them from
    the first available remix with the correct label, not just from a single specified remix (as
    before). See the README for more information

MINOR NEW FEATURES
- The flag printer can print a dozen or so new flags, each representing a common tool or item
- The format of the unilib text visible in the chat window on startup has been tweaked, also adding
    the time elapsed
- The global variables unilib.global.fishing_fish_list, unilib.global.fishing_bonus_list and
    unilib.global.fishing_junk_list now include, in their mini-lists, a .rarity property. Several
    fish-related packages have been updated to specify a .rarity. Calls to
    unilib.fishing.select_catch() now select a fish at random, taking into account their .rarity
- Material imported from minetest_game has been updated to match the current minetest_game release
    (wherever appropriate). unigame v1.1.0 has been updated in the same way
- In the "gaia" remix, beach level has been reduced from 4 to 3 (because of too much sand in lowland
    areas)
- In the "gaia" remix, tweaked the colours of some turfs for more pleasing aesthetics
- In the "gaia" remix, ores beneath the surface now match their surrounding stones, rather than
    being "embedded" in ordinary stone
- In the "hades" and "hades_jit" remixes, tweaked the probability of getting multiple lumps from a
    single ore, from 1/2 to 1/3 (ores generated by the "gaia" remix have the same probability)

FIXES
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

MAJOJR PACKAGE FIXES
- abm_nettle_plant_nettle_spread
    - Fixed a typo that causes a crash
- dirt_super_with_litter_forest, shared_woodsoils
    - The dirt package caused trunk nodes, placed on the ground by a player (perhaps as part of a
        building), to generate litter as it it were still in a tree. Changed the code to switch the
        .param2 for placed trunk nodes, resolving the problem
- item_rod_fishing
    - Fixed a crash that occured whenever the rod was used, due to an undefined global constant
        value. This same problem affected several other packages, including "shared_boats" and
        "shared_pedology"
- item_stick_fire
    - Wear was only applied to the stick when the player was in creative; fixed it, so that wear is
        only applied when the player is in survival
- plant_kelp_ordinary
    - Fixed a crash when the player tried to place this kelp on a dirt-with-turf node, due to a
        misnamed file in ../lib/shared/misc. Now, nothing happens when kelp is placed on a
        dirt-with-turf node, as intended
- tree_sakura
    - Edited the schematic "unilib_tree_sakura.mts" to place a trunk node just above the surface,
        replacing the gap which was present in the original mod, for no obvioius reason

MINOR PACKAGE FIXES
- admin_tool_tester_general
    - This item does nothing by default; added a log message explaining this, for the benefit of any
        player who stumbles across it
- chat_dump_node
    - "/dump_node unilib:dirt_ordinary" now outputs the definition of that exact node, not all the
        nodes whose names start with "unilib:dirt_ordinary". Comparable changes were made to
        /dump_biome, /dump_craftitem, /dump_decoration and /dump_tool
- item_net_bug
    - Tweaked the item's description so that its format matches lassos/nets from unimobs
- misc_calendar_fancy
    - Fixed the broken tooltips, also tweaking the format of some text
- shared_ethereal_fish
    - Calls to unilib.pkg.shared_ethereal_fish.register_fish() can now specify a .glow_flag
        property; also fixed the tetra fish that should glow, but did not
- vessel_bottle_glass_empty, vessel_bottle_glass_with_firefly
    - Changed the textures for these items, adding a "glow" so that they're easier to tell apart
        from the empty bottle

API FIXES
- unilib.trees.register_tree()
    - .burnlevel, if specified as an argument, was ignored. Fixed

MOD COMPATIBILITY FIXES
- mesecons
    - Was incompatible with unilib v1.0.0, even after applying the patch in
        ../scripts/mesecons_modpack. Applied numerous fixes; if you want to use unilib with
        mesecons, please re-download mesecons and apply the new patch
- petz
    - With the release of unimobs (which contains almost everything from petz), the patch for
        petz provided in unilib v1.0.0 is no longer necessary, and has been removed. Packages that
        include compatibility for various mob mods, are still compatible with petz (e.g see the
        "food_flan_vanilla" package). Therefore old games which include both unilib v1.0.0 and any
        version of petz should continue working as before

REMIX FIXES
- Fixed a number of problems in parsing the initial remix list: for example, in
    "mtgame !+shared_default_chest", the excluded "shared_default_chest" package was still loaded
    because it was a dependency of other packages that were loaded; it is now not loaded at all
- The "mtgame" remix will now work with the v6 mapgen, without producing a long list of errors in
    the chat window (although v6 limitations, such as hard-coded biomes, still apply)

MISCELLANEOUS FIXES
- Numerous fixes for typos and other spelling errors

RENAMED PACKAGES
- Some packages have been renamed, and the items they provide haev also been renamed. Aliases have
    been added to convert old items to new items, but you may need to update the package names in
    your own remixes:
        - "device_lever" renamed as "machine_lever"
        - "device_plate_pressure" renamed as "machine_plate_pressure"
- The "chat_show_biome" package has been renamed to "chat_display_biome"; the new chat command is
    /display_biome. unilib now includes a brand new "chat_show_biome" package. The new /show_biome
    shows text in the chat window, and /display_biome shows text in the HUD. There is also a new
    "chat_display_light" package, with the command /display_light
    
SPLIT PACKAGES
- Some packages have been split, but the items they provide have NOT been renamed. You may need to
    add the new package names to your own remixes:
        - "dirt_ordinary" split into: "dirt_ordinary", "dirt_ordinary_with_cover_snow",
            "dirt_ordinary_with_litter_coniferous", "dirt_ordinary_with_litter_rainforest",
            "dirt_ordinary_with_turf", "dirt_ordinary_with_turf_dry"
        - "dirt_dry" split into: "dirt_dry", "dirt_dry_with_turf_dry"
- Code from the "shared_nsspf" package, which spawned mushrooms in the world, mention specific
    dirts; this is unacceptable in a shared package, so those code blocks have been moved into three
    new packages, "deco_nsspf_mushroom_misc", "deco_nsspf_fungus_misc" and "deco_nsspf_truffle_misc"
- Much of the code from the "item_book_ordinary" has been moved to a shared package,
    "shared_default_book", so that it's available for use with other types of book
    
SYSTEM API CHANGES
- unilib.armour.get_player_texture(...)
    - Function is now deprecated (but still available to be called); new code should call
        unilib.armour.get_player_texture_data(...) instead

- unilib.armour.set_player_texture(...)
    - Function is now deprecated (but still available to be called); new code should call
        unilib.armour.set_player_texture_data(...) instead

- unilib.dynamic.register_extender(data_table)
    - data_table.chance has been renamed as data_table.probability (calling code must be updated)
    
- unilib.dynamic.register_flooder(data_table)
- unilib.dynamic.register_flooder_jit(data_table)
    - data_table.ore_table.chance has been renamed as data_table.ore_table.probability, and
        data_table.top_table.chance has been renamed as data_table.ore_table.probability (calling
        code must be updated)

- unilib.furniture.convert_to_container(data_table, old_rows, old_descrip, old_label)
    - This function will recognise calls using the old argument list in the form
        (full_name, rows, description, label), so there is no need to update calling code

MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES
- Dirt-with-turf nodes, when the turf is spreadable, now have the .spreading_dirt group (replace the
    old .spreading_dirt_type group). Dirt nodes with covers such as litter now have a new
    .covered_dirt group. In unilib, rainforest litter does not spread (although in the original
    minetest_game code, it did); the node's groups have been updated to match unilib behaviour

v1.0.0 (1 Jan 2025)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first beta release
- Future releases will NOT introduce game-breaking changes, so it is now safe to start a long-term
    game (or a server)

v0.15.0 (1 Oct 2023)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is the first alpha release
- Future releases may introduce game-breaking changes. Don't invest a lot of time and energy into
    your game (unless you are willing to maintain the code yourself)
