Some textures in the /textures folder generate Irrlicht errors; specifically:

    Irrlicht: PNG warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile
    Irrlicht: PNG warning: iCCP: cHRM chunk does not match sRGB
    
This folder contains a second copy of all non-compliant textures in the /archive folder. These
    textures have been fixed using the following system command:

    find . -type f -iname '*.png' -exec pngcrush -ow -rem allb -reduce {} \;

The python script in /scripts re-populates unilib's media folders from the archive folder. It
    copies textures in this folder last, to guarantee that the fixed files overwrite the broken
    files.
    
N.B. A single broken texture could be fixed (if necessary) using this command:

    pngcrush -ow -rem allb -reduce xxx.png

N.B. To identify broken textures, add this line to minetest.conf:

    debug_log_level = verbose
