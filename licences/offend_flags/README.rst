By Donald J Trump, adapted from the prideflags mod by Leslie E. Krause

Offensive Flags adds a variety of animated flags, at least one of which is guaranteed to be
offensive to someone. If you can't find a flag in this mod that outrages you, please submit a PR 
and I'll add some more flags.

Are you tired of that click click click click click click click click click click click click click
nonsense you've had to put up with while using other flag mods?

Well, this mod comes with a FREE flag printer. Yes, that's right! A completely free flag printer, at
no extra charge. Just craft the printer, a blank flag and some ink cartridges, and then you can
spend the rest of the day happily printing as many Donald Trump flags as you please.

If you find there's nothing worse than a load of players running around, digging up holes all over
your server, then this mod could be the right choice for you. Why not print off a thousand Donald
Trump flags and place them in a conspicuous location, so as to annoy and alienate as many players as
possible?

Are you going to steal my flag printer for your own flag mod? Well, go right ahead, buddy. Just
don't forget to credit this mod and its author! ;)
