# Minetest Stripped_Tree Mod

Adds stripped tree trunks to minetest.

You can choose between use axes or chisel to get the stripped trees, chisel is enabled by default but you can disable it at functions.lua "stripped_tree.ENABLE_CHISEL = true"

if you are using a chisel just left clic on the trunk. if you are using axes you get the stripped log with right clic.

you can get string and paper from bark!
