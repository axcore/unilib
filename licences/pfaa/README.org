  /Per Fabrica Ad Astra/ (through crafting, to the stars) is an
  extension (mod) of the game Minecraft. Broadly, it aims to enrich
  the science and engineering content of the game. The overarching
  goal is to instill love and knowledge of both disciplines in the
  heart and mind of the player. Since reality is often stranger and
  more interesting than fiction, many of the ideas are directly
  inspired by nature and actual science. Of course, gameplay takes
  precedence over realism, because if no one plays, no one learns.

  /Per Fabrica Ad Astra/ plans to be a collection of independent yet
  tightly integrated modules, each corresponding to a Forge
  mod. Players and server administrators may choose which to enable
  through configuration. Currently, there is only one working mod:
  /Geologica/. It adds realistic and interesting geology to Minecraft,
  with the goal of enhancing the mining experience. /Geologica/
  defines new types of rocks and minerals and relies on the Custom Ore
  Generator mod (which we also maintain) to place them in the
  world. Vanilla stone is completely replaced by the new types of
  rocks.  Mineral deposits, including metal ores and industrial
  minerals spawn in psuedo-realistic veins and clouds, accoding to the
  type of rock.

  Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to very much with the
  minerals. That is the point of chemistry and thus the /Chemica/ mod
  that is only just beginning to take shape. However, we use the
  Forge ore dictionary so that some common minerals can be processed
  via other mods, in particular GregTech.
