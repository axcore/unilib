# "moretrees" remix - contains everything from moretrees
# See the STANDARDS file for more information about what belongs in each category, and what does not
# Some code has been simplified. Coconuts and dates do not regrow. Date palm trees are not
#       pollinated
# Raw coconuts have been merged with coconut slices from ethereal-ng
# Calls to biome_lib have been crudely emulated by Minetest decorations, so trees will not spawn in
#       the same positions/quantities
# Coconuts can only be cut with cutting boards
