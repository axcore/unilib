The files in this folder are when unilib is copied into unigame (in its ../mods folder).

1. settingtypes.txt replaces the file in the unigame copy of unilib's main folder

2. global_settings.lua replaces the file in the unigame copy of unilib's ../lib/system/global/
    folder

3. imported.csv replaces the file in the unigame copy of unilib's ../csv/mods/ folder

4. In init.lua, must change the default value of the "unilib_show_startup_msg_flag" setting, by
    replacing this line:

        local show_flag = core.settings:get_bool("unilib_show_startup_msg_flag", true)

...with this one:

        local show_flag = core.settings:get_bool("unilib_show_startup_msg_flag", false)
