This folder contains files to patch the mesecons modpack to work with unilib.

init.lua
Copy this file to ../meseconds/gamecompat, replacing the existing init.lua

compat_unilib.lua
Also copy this file to ../meseconds/gamecompat, not replacing any existing file

You must also make sure that unilib is loaded first, probably by adding unilib to
    ../meseconds/gamecompat/mod.conf, for example:

    optional_depends = fire, default, dye, mesecons_mvps, tnt, unilib
