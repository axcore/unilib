This folder contains files to patch the petz modpack to work with unilib.

user_mtgame.conf
Updates to the original petz configuration file, with all minetest_game items switched for their
    unilib equivalents
This file can be used with the "mtgame" remix. Copy it to the .../petz/petz folder, and rename it to
    "user.conf"

user_gaia.conf
Updates to the original petz configuration file, with all minetest_game items switched for suitable
    unilib items
This file can be used with the "gaia" remix. Copy it to the .../petz/petz folder, and rename it to
    "user.conf"

You must also make sure that unilib is loaded first, probably by adding unilib to the
    ../petz/petz/mod.conf file, for example:

    optional_depends = bonemeal, 3d_armor, crops, playerphysics, player_monoids, unilib
