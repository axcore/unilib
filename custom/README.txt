This folder can be used to store your own remixes and packages. Files in the /custom/packages and /custom/remixes folders are automatically loaded by unilib.

Files in the /custom/models, /custom/mts, /custom/sounds and /custom/textures folders are not automatically loaded by unilib. You can use the Python script, /scripts/repopulate_media_folders.py, to copy the files to the correct location. 

No future release of unilib will ever add new files to this folder.
