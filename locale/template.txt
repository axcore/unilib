Nether Portal=
Construction requires 14 blocks of obsidian, which we found deep underground where water had solidified molten rock. The finished frame is four blocks wide, five blocks high, and stands vertically, like a doorway.@n@nThis opens to a truly hellish place, though for small mercies the air there is still breathable. There is an intriguing dimensional mismatch happening between this realm and ours, as after opening the second portal into it we observed that 10 strides taken in the Nether appear to be an equivalent of @1 in the natural world.@n@nThe expedition parties have found no diamonds or gold, and after an experienced search party failed to return from the trail of a missing expedition party, I must conclude this is a dangerous place.=
